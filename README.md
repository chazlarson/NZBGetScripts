# NZBGetScripts
==========

A home for some NZBGet Post-Process Scripts, at this point just so I can easily find them again.

1. ExtendedUnrar.py
    - This script extracts nested rar archives from downloaded files.
    - came from nzbget forums in this thread: https://forum.nzbget.net/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=1690
